# Scientific Calculator

A web-based scientific calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using `math.js` for safe expression evaluation. Features include basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentiation, and a calculation history.

## Features
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Scientific functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`, `log` (base 10), `^` (exponentiation).
- Constants: `π` (pi) and `e` (Euler's number).
- Keyboard input support for numbers, operators, and basic commands (Enter to calculate, Escape to clear).
- Calculation history display.
- Responsive design with a clean, modern UI.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
